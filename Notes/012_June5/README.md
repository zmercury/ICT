#### Do While loop:

Do while loop is the post test loop which checks the condition while exiting from the loop. it uses do... while keywords. The do... while loop is terminated with semicolon.

Syntax:

```c
initialization;
do {
    Body of loop,
    increment/decrement;
} while(condition);
```

> Note: The do... while executes at lease once if condition is false at beginning of loop. 

Although the condition is not true, the loop runs once because it is a post test loop! It checks the loop at first and runs it before realizing that the condition is wrong!
