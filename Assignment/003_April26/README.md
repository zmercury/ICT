### Programming


#### Syntax

``` c 
if ( condition) {
    statement....
} else {
    statement....
}
```

#### if....else.... statement

Here, the condition is tested and if condition is true then one hock of code is executed, otherwise another block of code is excuted. 

```c 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    printf("Enter the age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age );

    if ( age > 18) {
        printf("You can vote!");
    } else {
        printf("You cannot vote!");
    }
    return 0;
}

```
